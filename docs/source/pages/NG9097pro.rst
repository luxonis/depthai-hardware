Overview
********

The **OAK-D Pro PoE** is an upgraded version of :ref:`OAK-D-PoE`, featuring **IR laser dot projector** (active stereo) and **IR illumination LED** (for
night-vision). It's also smaller and lighter than the OAK-D-PoE.

It also has industrial **M12 PoE connector** (instead of RJ45) and additionally features
**M8 connector for IO connectivity**; USB2 (D+, D-), camera IOs (FSIN, STROBE), power, and one auxiliary GPIO.

It's currenty in **beta stage** so you have to use a custom version of the depthai library to communicate with this device,
