Waterproof enclosures
=====================

OAK-1 and OAK-D enclosures
*************************

OAK-1 and OAK-D enclosures aren't waterproof, since they don't have a `gasket <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasket>`__ (only POE enclosures have it, image below).

IP67 rated PoE enclosures
*************************

PoE devices (:ref:`OAK-D-POE <sj2088poe>` and :ref:`OAK-1-POE <sj2096>`) are shipped with an **IP67** rated enclosure. `IP code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code>`__
tells you whether a device is dustproof and/or waterproof. IP67 means that the device is **protected from total dust ingress** and that
it's **protected from water immersion between 15 centimeters and 1 meter in depth.** 

PoE enclosures have gaskets which makes them waterproof.

Here's our testing of the enclosures. The heigth of this drum, which was filled with water, is 1 meter and we were testing these two enclosures over an extended period of time.
