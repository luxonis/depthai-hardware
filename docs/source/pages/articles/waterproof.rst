Waterproof enclosures
=====================

OAK-1 and OAK-D enclosures
**************************

OAK-1 and OAK-D enclosures aren't waterproof, since they don't have a `gasket <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasket>`__ (only PoE enclosures have it, image below).

IP67 rated PoE enclosures
*************************

**Series 1** PoE devices (:ref:`OAK-D-POE <sj2088poe>` and :ref:`OAK-1-POE <sj2096>`) are shipped with an **IP67** rated enclosure. `IP code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code>`__
tells you whether a device is dustproof and/or waterproof. IP67 means that the device is **protected from total dust ingress** and that
it's **protected from water immersion between 15 centimeters and 1 meter in depth.** 

Initial **Series 2** PoE devices (:ref:`OAK-D S2 PoE`/:ref:`W <OAK-D W PoE>` and :ref:`OAK-D Pro PoE`/:ref:`W <OAK-D Pro W PoE>`)
have **IP65 rated enclosure**. **Future batches** (manufactured in Q2 2024 or later) will have **IP67** rated enclosure.

PoE enclosures have gaskets which makes them waterproof.

Here's our testing of the enclosures. The height of this drum, which was filled with water, is 1 meter and we were testing these two enclosures over an extended period of time.
