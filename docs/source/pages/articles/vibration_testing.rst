Vibration Tolerance
===================

In the industrial world, cameras need to be as tough as the environments they operate in. As some of our customers are using our cameras in harsh environments (eg. on heavy machinery), we have
tested our cameras for vibration tolerance according to the **EN 60068-2-6:2008** standard.

We have tested the following cameras:

- :ref:`OAK-D Pro` - indirectly also :ref:`OAK-D S2`, :ref:`OAK-D Pro W`, :ref:`OAK-D W`
- :ref:`OAK-D Pro PoE` - indirectly also :ref:`OAK-D S2 PoE`, :ref:`OAK-D W PoE`, :ref:`OAK-D Pro W PoE`
- :ref:`OAK-D-PoE`

Indirectly meaning that the cameras are the same (electrically and mechanically), they just have different cameras equipped or added dot projector and flood LED.

Vibration Results
*****************

`Vibration Results here <https://www.luxonis.com/assets/marketing/certificates/Vibration_Test_Results.pdf>`__.
We have tested our cameras before and after the vibration stress test, to determine whether there is any degradation in the camera performance.
We have tested these parameters:

- **Camera Focus** - checks if the focus (optics) of cameras have changed. **Passed**
- **Camera Angles** - checks if the camera angles have changed, has to be below 0.5°. **Passed**
- **Stereo Depth Accuracy** - checks if stereo depth accuracy has changed (in mm accuracy). **Passed**

Vibration Report
****************

`Vibration Report here <https://www.luxonis.com/assets/marketing/certificates/Vibration_Test_Report.pdf>`__ . Vibration stress tests have been
performed by the `SIQ <https://www.siq.si/en/>`__, which is an independent third-party testing laboratory. As per the **EN 60068-2-6:2008** standard, they have
performed sinus vibration test from 5 Hz to 200 Hz at 1 octave per minute, with acceleration amplitude of 50 m/s^2, for all 3 axes separately (X, Y, Z).
