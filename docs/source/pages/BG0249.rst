Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-IMX378** is a carrier board for the Arducam PY011 IMX378 camera module, and is designed to be compatible with
:ref:`OAK-FFC-3P`, :ref:`OAK-FFC-4P`, and :ref:`DepthAI RPi HAT <DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard>` baseboards. A 26-pin FFC is used
to carry 5V power, 4-lane MIPI, I2C, and other control signals between the this camera module and the controller baseboard.

Getting started
***************

Camera module compatibility is known for the Arducam PY011 IMX378 module (and previously used Sunny A12N02A), but not tested for other modules. The FFC connector is an 0.5mm pitch, 
26-pin, and bottom-contact, across which travels the 4-lane MIPI, 5V, I2C, camera clock, camera reset, and other optional control lines. 
5V power is regulated down and filtered as appropriate to meet the requirements of the compact camera module and IMX378.
