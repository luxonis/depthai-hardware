Overview
********

**OAK-SoM-MAX** has :ref:`RVC3`, and **quadcore ARM CPU** on board. The OAK-SoM-MAX is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level system with
a need for a low-power, high performance, real-time AI and depth perception.

The OAK-SoM-MAX interfaces with the system through three 10-Gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which
carries all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary
digital and analog power.

Devices that use OAK-SoM-Max
****************************

All devices that have SoM on-board are also open-source. If you are interested in integrating DepthAI (via SoM)
into your product, see :ref:`documentation here <integrating_depthai_into_products>`.

OAK-SoM-MAX variants
********************

We offer 3 variants of the OAK-SoM-Max which expose a different configuration of MIPI connectivity:

- **OAK-SoM-MAX** - 6x 2-lane MIPI. This is the default configuration
- **OAK-SoM-MAX-1** - 4x 2-lane MIPI, 1x 4-lane MIPI. RX0+RX1 are merged into a single 4-lane MIPI
- **OAK-SoM-MAX-2** - 2x 2-lane MIPI, 2x 4-lane MIPI. RX0+RX1 and RX4+RX5 are merged into 4-lane MIPI
