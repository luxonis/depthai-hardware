Overview
********

The DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard (BW1094) baseboard has three FFC interfaces which allow for two :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` camera modules (stereo pair) and one 
:ref:`OAK-FFC-IMX378 <bg0249>` RGB camera module. The GPIO interface from the Raspberry Pi Model B variants is passed through the BW1094 with 
the exception of the 5V pins, GND pins, and BCM GPIO26 (pin 37), which is used as a way for the Raspberry Pi to reset the :ref:`OAK-SoM`,
parallel to the RST button.

To see **which cameras are compatible with this OAK FFC baseboard**, see the guide here: :ref:`OAK FFC camera modules`.
Some of camera modules have a :ref:`M12 mount <M12 mount lenses>`, so you can use different lenses to get **custom FoV** (with :ref:`wide or narrow FOV M12 lenses <M12 selectable FOV>`).

Getting started
***************

The stereo mono cameras (:ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>`) can be connected via FFC to connectors J8 and J9 on the top of the board, while the RGB camera
module (:ref:`OAK-FFC-IMX378 <bg0249>`) is connected via FFC to connector J6 on the bottom of the board. These connectors have a Left/Right configuration as
perceived by the subject rather than the camera, so "CAM_L" is the subject's left. These designations are somehwhat arbitrary, however, due to the
flexibility in positioning the cameras allowed by the FFC. Note that the RGB FFC connector is a top-contact connector while the mono FFC connectors are
bottom-contact. This results in the FFCs and cameras all facing the same direction when mounted.

The DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard accepts 5V power from the 5.5mm x 2.5mm barrel jack, or through the Raspberry Pi GPIO header 5V pins. This allows support for `standalone <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/tutorials/standalone_mode/>`__
use of the baseboard when it is not mounted as a HAT. When using the DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard as a HAT, it is recommended to power it from the Raspberry Pi via
the 5V GPIO pins. It is also possible to back-power the Raspberry Pi from the DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard, but this is not recommended. Do not apply power to the BW1094
barrel jack and to the Raspberry Pi at the same time.

The Raspberry Pi GPIO header mostly passes through the DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard with exception of the 5V pins, GND pins, and BCM GPIO26 (pin 37), which is used as a way
to toggle reset on the :ref:`OAK-SoM`. Reset is active high when toggled from the Raspberry Pi on BCM GPIO26. The 3.3V Raspberry Pi GPIO line is level
shifted with an inverter to 1.8V, which is the standard IO for the OAK-SoM. OAK-SoM reset is active-low 1.8V. The reset button on board the
DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard resets the OAK-SoM only.

Auxiliary 1.8V IO for the OAK-SoM exist as J10 pads. The unpopulated connector is Amphenol/FCI 20021121-00020T1LF. Quad SPI, UART, I2C, SoM PGOOD,
and, SoM WAKEUP are exposed at these pads. NOTE: these are all 1.8V signals and will require appropriate level shifting if connected to the 3.3V GPIO
of the Raspberry Pi.

The 2485_PGOOD LED indicates "power good" for the OAK-SoM. The 5V_PWR LED 5V power is applied to the DepthAI RPi HAT Baseboard.
