Overview
========

**OAK FFC** baseboards and camera modules are great for prototyping flexibility. Since **cameras are modular**, you can place them
at **various stereo baselines** and select the camera module based on your project requirements (resolution, shutter type, FPS, optics).

OAK FFC baseboards
******************

OAK FFC baseboards are OAK devices that have onboard VPU and FFC connectors, to which you can connect :ref:`OAK FFC camera modules <FFC Camera modules>`.
Here's the list of our current OAK FFC baseboards:

FFC Camera modules
******************

Here's the list of already built OAK FFC camera modules, which you can easily connect to any :ref:`OAK FFC baseboard <OAK FFC baseboards>`
with a flat flexible cable. We are working towards offering OAK FFC camera module for :ref:`all supported CCMs <Already built CCMs>`.

FFC camera mounting
*******************

**OAK-FFC Kit** is a great way to mount your OAK FFC camera modules. It allows you to easily customize both **horizontal and vertical stereo baseline**.
You can buy it from `our shop <https://shop.luxonis.com/collections/modular-cameras/products/oak-ffc-kit>`__. For usage, see `instruction here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/blob/master/oak-ffc-kit/OAK-FFC-Kit_assembly_instruction.pdf>`__.

.. thumbnail:: /_static/images/arducam/ffc-kit.jpg

Mounting adapters can also be found `on Github <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/adapters>`__.

Raspberry Pi cameras modules
****************************

Raspberry Pi sells a `number of camera modules <https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html>`__ that are compatible with the OAK FFC baseboards.
RPi cameras can be connected to the FFC baseboard via the `RPi Camera Adapter <https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-ffc-2rpi-tbd>`__.

     - Rolling

   * - `RPi Global Shutter Camera <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/>`__
     - IMX296
     - Global
     - 1.6 MP
     - Color, C/CS mount. Might have color artifacts, see `workaround here <https://discuss.luxonis.com/d/2372-rpi-global-shutter-camera-imx296-module/7>`__

.. note::

  The UC-244 Adapter doesn't work out-of-the-box with the RPi HQ and Global Shutter cameras, additional steps are `required and described here <https://discuss.luxonis.com/d/1460-rpi-high-quality-camera-with-oak-ffc-baseboard>`__.

If you just want to use IMX477, we suggest using `Arducam HQ Cam for RPi, IMX477 <https://www.arducam.com/product/b0240-arducam-imx477-hq-quality-camera/>`__ that works directly with OAK FFC baseboards (without the UC-244 adapter).

M12 mount lenses
****************

Some of the FFC camera modules above have **M12 mount**, so you can use a variety of **different lenses** (for **custom FoV**), for example:

- Kit of `10 different M12 lenses <https://www.arducam.com/product/m12-mount-camera-lens-kit-arduino-raspberry-pi/>`__ (for testing purposes),
- `M25156H14 (HFoV: 141°C) <https://www.arducam.com/product/M25156H14/>`__,
- `M40180H10 (HFoV: 100°C) <https://www.arducam.com/product/M40180H10/>`__,
- `M2506ZH04 (HFoV: 33°C) <https://www.arducam.com/product/M2506ZH04/>`__,
- and `others <https://www.arducam.com/product-category/lenses/m12-lens-arducam/>`__

M12 selectable FOV
******************

Tests were done using 2x `OAK-FFC-IMX477-M12 <https://shop.luxonis.com/collections/modular-cameras/products/oak-ffc-imx477>`__ and two
different M12 lenses: `20° FOV <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-telephoto-20-degree-1-2-3-m12-mount-with-lens-adapter-for-raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/>`__
and `190° FOV <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-190-degrees-lens-for-hq-camera-ln074/>`__ one.
