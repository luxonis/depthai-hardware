OAK-D-IOT-40
============

.. warning::
    OAK IoT series is now **community supported only**, and is **provided as-is**. This means we most likely **won't update it** and **we don't provide support** for it (Discord, forums, email...).

Overview
********

The **OAK-D-IoT-40** baseboard has three on-board cameras which implement stereo and RGB vision, piped directly into the
:ref:`OAK-SoM-IoT` for depth and AI processing. The data can be then output to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 (Type-C) or
via ESP32 WiFi interface. If you are **new to OAK IOT devices, you can check** :ref:`Getting started with OAK IOT devices` tutorial.

This design is one of two baseboards for the :ref:`OAK-SoM-IoT`, the other one being :ref:`OAK-D-IOT-75`. The only difference
is the stereo baseline distance and the shape/size of the OAK camera.

Getting started
***************

The OAK-D-IoT-40 accepts power input from 5V barrel jack and it can also accept power from USB C connector. Booting can be accomplished from either 
the ESP32 or NOR flash on the :ref:`BW1099EMB <bw1099>`, boot selection is configured on BW1099EMB with BOOT resistors.

* The reset button resets the :ref:`OAK-SoM-IoT` only.
* The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the DM1092.
* The PG LED indicates "power good" from the OAK-SoM-IoT.
* The "RUN" LED indicates that the OAK-SoM-IoT is not reset.
