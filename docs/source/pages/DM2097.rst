Overview
********

The **OAK-D CM4 PoE** is an upgraded version of :ref:`OAK-D-CM4`, as PoE is used both for power delivery and communication
for the Rasbperry Pi `Compute Module 4 <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000>`__,
plus it comes in a IP67 rated enclosure. The enclosure is about the size as the :ref:`OAK-D-POE`.
The color camera is also close to the right camera, so RGB-depth alignment isn't needed in most cases, which reduces system load.

The OAK-D CM4 PoE combines a host (RPi CM4) and the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro` to allow for a fully standalone and integrated solution
for real-time `Spatial AI <https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/spatial-ai/>`__.
