Overview
********

The **OAK-D CM4 PoE** is an upgraded version of :ref:`OAK-D-CM4`, as PoE is used both for power delivery and communication
for the Raspberry Pi `Compute Module 4 <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000>`__ (No wireless, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, PN: CM4004032),
and it comes in a IP67 rated enclosure. The enclosure is about the size as the :ref:`OAK-D-POE`.
The color camera is also close to the right camera, so RGB-depth alignment isn't needed in most cases, which reduces system load.

The OAK-D CM4 PoE combines a host (RPi CM4) and the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro` to allow for a fully standalone and integrated solution
for real-time `Spatial AI <https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/spatial-ai/>`__.

PoE for RPi, not OAK
####################

.. note::
   Even though this device supports PoE, it doesn't behave like an :ref:`OAK POE devices <PoE Designs>`!

You could look at this device exactly like having an **Raspberry Pi 4 with an OAK-D** connected to it (via USB), **and** having a
**PoE hat** on the RPi.

Development works in the same way - user has to SSH/VNC into the RPi (:ref:`see here <SSH into the RPi>`), and then execute
the scripts/apps on the RPi which connect to "the OAK" (OAK SOM). RPi CM4 is connected via USB3 (on PCB) to the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro`.

So **users** that have this device **shouldn't follow** :ref:`Getting started with OAK PoE devices` guide, even though this device
has ``PoE`` in the name.
