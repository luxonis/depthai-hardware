Overview
********

The OAK-1 offers a quick and simple way to add USB3 Type-C device power and connectivity, and a single 12MP RGB camera module to 
the :ref:`OAK-SoM <bw1099>`.

Some part of the design cannot be open-sourced because they contain proprietary chip-down vendor information and therefore cannot be shared publicly.

OAK-1 isn’t a standard USB camera. It’s a 4-trillion-operations-per-second AI powerhouse that performs your AI models on-board, so that your host 
is free to do whatever you need it to do.  

Its integrated 12 MegaPixel camera module communicates over an on-board 2.1 Gbps MIPI interface directly to the Myriad X, which ingests this data 
and performs neural inference on it, returning the results over USB.

Such a data path offloads the host processor from all of this work. In the common use case of object detection from a 12MP image, this means your 
host is now dealing with a 24 Kbps stream of what the objects are and where they are in the image, instead of a 2.1 Gbps stream of video.  
So an 87,500 reduction in data your host has to deal with.

Below is an example of running MobileNet-SSD:

* OAK-1 + Raspberry Pi: 50+FPS, 0% RPi CPU Utilization
* NCS2 + Raspberry Pi: 8FPS, 225% CPU Utilization
