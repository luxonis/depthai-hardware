Overview
********

The **OAK-D Pro W** has **Wide Field of View (FOV) cameras** and features an **IR laser dot projector** (active stereo) and **IR illumination LED** (for
night-vision). The OAK-D Pro W is from the :ref:`Series 2 of OAK cameras <OAK series 2>`.

Compared to the :ref:`OAK-D S2`, the only differences are:

- IR laser dot projector and IR illumination LED (:ref:`Pro aspect <Pro version>` of the version)
- Wide FOV cameras (:ref:`W aspect <Wide FOV>` of the version)

Due to the large power consumption of dot projector/illumination LED, a :ref:`Y-adapter` **is required** when using these functions!

Looking for the **Normal FOV** OAK-D Pro? You can find it :ref:`here <dm9098pro>`.
