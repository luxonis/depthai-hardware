Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-6P** baseboard has **6 FFC interfaces** which allows for **six 2-lane MIPI** camera modules. It is the
first device from :ref:`OAK Series 3` (with RVP3) and uses the :ref:`dm3399`.

To see **which cameras are compatible with this OAK FFC baseboard**, see the guide here: :ref:`OAK FFC camera modules`.
Some of camera modules have a :ref:`M12 mount <M12 mount lenses>`, so you can use different lenses to get **custom FoV** (with :ref:`wide or narrow FOV M12 lenses <M12 selectable FOV>`).

This board is also compatible with RPi camera interface. For that you will need a `FFC from Arducam <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-12mp-imx477-mini-high-quality-camera-with-m12-mount-lens-and-adapter-board-for-depthai/>`__,
which converts 26-pin Luxonis camera pinout to 22 pin RPi camera pinout.

In addition, IMU (over SPI) sensor is also added to this OAK FFC board.

Getting started
***************

In this tutorial, we will be using OAK-FFC-6P with 2x OAK-FFC-OV9282 camera modules. First we will install the correct
depthai library version, then we will calibrate the stereo cameras, and finally we will check the results.

.. image:: 

RVC3 library
------------

As RVC3 is still in early access, you will need to install the correct version of depthai library on the host computer.
You can do that by checking out on ``rvc3_develop`` on the **depthai-python** repository and running ``python example/install_requirements.py``.

Now, let's check the cameras streams first. As we have OV9282 on ports B and C, we will run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python cam_test.py -cams left,m right,m

    Enabled cameras:
        left : mono
        right : mono
    DepthAI version: 2.19.1.0.dev+c5fd7c993a3d446f6b9fdb54653cb49c7523534f
    DepthAI path: path/to/depthai.cp39-win_amd64.pyd
        Connected cameras: [{socket: LEFT/CAM_B, sensorName: OV9282, width: -1, height: -1, orientation: AUTO, supportedTypes: [], hasAutofocus: 0, name: CAM-SA}, {socket: RIGHT/CAM_C, sensorName: OV9282, width: -1, height: -1, orientation: AUTO, supportedTypes: [], hasAutofocus: 0, name: CAM-SB}]
        -socket LEFT  : OV9282   -1 x   -1 focus:fixed -
        -socket RIGHT : OV9282   -1 x   -1 focus:fixed -
    USB speed: UNKNOWN
    IR drivers: []
    Cam:      left          right    [host | capture timestamp]
    FPS:  24.61| 21.96  24.31| 21.44

And we get the streams from both cameras.

RVC3 SSH into ARM
-----------------

RVC3 also has quadcore ARM, so it's also possible to SSH into the device and install the same library (so ``rvc3_develop``) there. To SSH
into the device, please see `gdocs here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r3en4EqgDG3hum8o5yS1DJ5vSCb6aNqyA38tIM8723U/edit#heading=h.xush1yeo9n1f>`__.
Note that because the device doesn't have internet access, you'd need to download and copy the library from the host computer to the device.

Calibration
-----------

Now, let's calibrate the cameras. First, we need to be on the ``rvc3_develop`` branch on the **depthai** repository. We need to have all the requirements installed,
and also make sure we still have the correct depthai library (as we did in the previous step). Following the `Calibration docs here <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/guides/calibration.html>`__,
I ran the calibrate.py file in the depthai repository:

.. code-block::

    python calibrate.py -s 5 -brd board.json -db -cd 0

And the board.json file is the following:

.. code-block::

    {
        "board_config":
        {
            "name": "OAK-FFC-6P",
            "revision": "R0M0E0",
            "cameras":{
                "CAM_B": {
                    "name": "left",
                    "hfov":  77,
                    "type": "mono",
                    "extrinsics": {
                        "to_cam": "CAM_C",
                        "specTranslation": {
                            "x": -9.75,
                            "y": 0,
                            "z": 0
                        },
                        "rotation":{
                            "r": 0,
                            "p": 0,
                            "y": 0
                        }
                    }
                },
                "CAM_C": {
                    "name": "right",
                    "hfov":  77,
                    "type": "mono"
                    }
            },
            "stereo_config":{
                "left_cam": "CAM_B",
                "right_cam": "CAM_C"
            }
        }
    }

    After 39 images at different angles and orientations, I got an average epipolar error of 0.14 pixels. Not great, not terrible, but will do for the tutorial.
    Now let's try our the stereo depth.

Testing the stereo results
--------------------------

We will be using SDK to test the results. Here's a simple script we can use to test the results:

.. code-block:: python

    from depthai_sdk import OakCamera

    with OakCamera() as oak:
        camb = oak.create_camera('camb,m', resolution='800p',fps=10)
        camc = oak.create_camera('camc,m', resolution='800p',fps=10)

        stereo = oak.create_stereo(left=camb, right=camc)

        oak.visualize([stereo.out.disparity, camc, stereo.out.rectified_left], fps=True)

        oak.start(blocking=True)

Note that depthai_sdk library should be installed from the ``rvc3_develop`` branch on depthai repository. After I run the script, I get this result:

.. image:: 


Hardware setup
**************

The OAK-FFC-6P accepts 5V (+/-10%) from a 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack, and interfaces to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C.
With cameras and the :ref:`dm3399`, total power consumption usually stays below the 1.5 A specification, Type-C power
of 1.5 A or greater is recommended.

Interfacing with the :ref:`dm3399` is also possible with OAK-FFC-6P connector pads QSPI, and AUX. These pads
are designed for the Amphenol/FCI 20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout
information.

The reset button soft resets the Luxonis DepthAI SoM only, SYS-RST button resets the power system of the DepthAI
and PWR button is a GPIO button that can be used to turn off/on the SoM. BOOT button is meant to be used only for
recovery purposes changing GPIO boot mode to eMMC recovery when the button is held on system power up.

The PG LED indicates 5V power is present and all outputs of the DC-DC converters are inside the specified nominal
voltages. The LED1 indicates "BOOT" status of the DepthAI SoM. The LED2 is an "CONNECT" status LED which indicates
that the OAK-SoM-Max is connected to the network/device.

FFC cables
**********

For FFC cables we use `Molex series 15166 <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/partSearch?query=15166>`__. Along with the OAK FFC board, we ship
**26 pin count, same-sided, 152mm** cables (part number `151660281 <https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/cable/0151660281>`__).
If you would like to use **shorter/longer FFC cables**, you can get them `here <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/deepSearch?pQuery=q%253D*%253A*%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dproductseries%253A%252215166%2522%252BOR%252Bengineeringnumber%253A%252215166%2522%2540fq%253Dcategory%253A%2522Cable%2522%2540fq%253Dcircuitsloaded%253A%252226%2522&currentQuery=contactlayouttype%3AA%2B%2528same%2Bside%2529&origin=_l1stv13w>`__.
