Overview
********

Y-adapter is used to **supply power to OAK cameras** through USB-C connector. Note that in most cases, host computer is
able to provide enough current (>1A) and you don't need a Y-adapter. **Y-adapter is only needed** in cases where host is not able
to provide enough current:

- For **Pro** versions (:ref:`OAK-D Pro`, :ref:`OAK-D Pro PoE`), where IR LED and dot projector can draw up to 1A alone
- In case you are using small SBC like :ref:`Raspberry Pi <OAK & Raspberry Pi>`, and OAK camera isn't the only USB device that's drawing power

Older (pre-2022) versions of OAK cameras have power barrel jack for supplying power (instead of the Y-adapter), while
newer OAK cameras only have USB-C connector - which is why we engineered the Y-adapter.

Getting started
***************

#. Connect host computer to the Y-adapter's USB-C data port via USB-C cable
#. Connect 5V voltage (eg. standard USB wall charger) to the Y-adapter's USB-C power port via USB-C cable
#. Insert Y-adapter to the OAK device via USB-C connector
