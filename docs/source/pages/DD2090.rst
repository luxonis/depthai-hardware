Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-4P** (DD2090FFC) baseboard has **4 FFC interfaces** which allows for:

- **Two 2-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` (stereo pair)
- **Two 4-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-IMX378 <bg0249>` RGB camera module, or additional :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` if RGB camera module is not required

Please note that only revision R1M1E1 and newer camera modules can be connected to this OAK FFC board.

This board is also compatible with RPi camera interface. For that you will need a `FFC from Arducam <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-12mp-imx477-mini-high-quality-camera-with-m12-mount-lens-and-adapter-board-for-depthai/>`__,
which converts 26-pin Luxonis camera pinout to 22 pin RPi camera pinout.

To see which cameras are compatible with this OAK FFC board, see the guide here: :ref:`compatible Arducam cameras <arducam-compatible-cameras>`.
Those cameras have a M12 mount, so you can use different lenses to get **custom FoV** (they have wide and narrow angle M12 lenses).

In addition, IMU (over SPI) sensor is also added to this OAK FFC board.

Minimal and maximal perceiving distances of the camera
******************************************************

Minimal depth perceiving distance of the camera depends on mono camera FOV, resolution, baseline and stereo depth mode,
more info is available on the `Stereo Depth documentation <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#min-stereo-depth-distance>`__.

Since this OAK FFC board has modular mono cameras, it also has a custom baseline (depending on how it is set up). The formulas
for minimal depth perceiving distances are:

- Min distance (800P) = :code:`882.5 * baseline / 95`
- Min distance (400P) = :code:`441.25 * baseline / 95`
- Min distance with extended disparity (800P) = :code:`882.5 * baseline / 190`
- Min distance with extended disparity (400P) = :code:`max(441.25 * baseline / 190, 19.6)`

Maximal perceiving distance for this OAK FFC board = :code:`baseline/2 * tan((90 - 71.9/1280) * PI/180)`

For more information about the maximum distance see the `Stereo Depth documentation <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#max-stereo-depth-distance>`__.

Getting started
***************

The OAK-FFC-4P is powered via USB Type-C or from a 5V, 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack, and interfaces to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C. With cameras and the
:ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro`, total power consumption usually stays below the 900ma specification of USB 3, but Type-C power of 1.5A or greater is recommended.

Interfacing with the OAK-SoM-Pro is also possible with OAK-FFC-4P connector pads J3, J4, and J5. These pads are designed for the Amphenol/FCI
20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout information.

The reset button resets the OAK-SoM-Pro only. The boot button overrides boot mode to USB boot if different boot mode is set on
the NOR Flash.

The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the board. The PG LED indicates "power good" from the OAK-SoM-Pro. The "RUN" LED indicates that the 
OAK-SoM-Pro is not in reset.

FFC cables
**********

For FFC cables we use `Molex series 15166 <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/partSearch?query=15166>`__. Along with the OAK FFC board, we ship
**26 pin count, same-sided, 152mm** cables (part number `151660281 <https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/cable/0151660281>`__).
If you would like to use **shorter/longer FFC cables**, you can get them `here <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/deepSearch?pQuery=q%253D*%253A*%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dproductseries%253A%252215166%2522%252BOR%252Bengineeringnumber%253A%252215166%2522%2540fq%253Dcategory%253A%2522Cable%2522%2540fq%253Dcircuitsloaded%253A%252226%2522&currentQuery=contactlayouttype%3AA%2B%2528same%2Bside%2529&origin=_l1stv13w>`__.
