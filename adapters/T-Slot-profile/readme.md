# T-slot profile adapters

## VESA mount adapter for T-slot

On all of our camera enclosures we have VESA mount M4 screw holes which allows for easy installation. We have designed 3D printable adapter for all of our camera
enclosures, and this adapter allows you to attach the camera horizontally or vertically.

## OAK Modular Cameras

These are still Work-in-Progress, and we are waiting for them to print to evaluate the models.

- `OAK_FCC_ADAPTER` allows you to attach [OAK FFC camera modules](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/arducam.html) to the T-slot profile (larger Arducam camera modules and also smaller Luxonis camera modules)
- `OAK_FCC_Board_ADAPTER` allows you to attach [OAK-FFC-3P](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM1090.html) or [OAK-FFC-4P](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DD2090.html) to the T-slot profile.
