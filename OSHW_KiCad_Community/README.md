# DepthAI Open Source Hardware KiCad Community

An open source, community KiCad folder is also available for sharing KiCad based designs and components. 

## Contents

### Footprints

Contains entire *converted* altium luxonis-depthAI footprint library. Dimensions unconfirmed where noted. As they are checked they should be placed into the master library. Same goes for any footprints you create for a depthAI related design. 

### Schematic Libraries

Kicad depthAI schematic symbols. All are correct, some are missing, many have not had their footprint checked and assigned (but all are available in footprints). Still, use KiCad libraries if you have the part - will already have a model and footprint associated. 

### Reference Designs

For KiCad versions of the reference designs provided in altium or their derivatives. Right now just the BW1098OBC partially completed and a new daughter board design that is WIP

### SoMs

this folder contains work on the 100 pin SoM connector using v6 of KiCad. The footprints folder and schematic libraries folders have it for v5. Going forward save v6 symbols with _v6 at the end so they can be differentiated (kicad v5 cannot use v6 footprints and symbols)
### Note: 

KiCad versions of reference designs, footprint/schematic libraries are still very much in the early stages. Once a few designs are complete and more footprints are confirmed, etc, it will be noted which parts of this directory are complete and may be used for reference while others will be marked WIP. For now assume all subdirectories to be in progress unless otherwise noted but please feel free to fork and add what you can to help out with the depthAI community.
