# Project Stage

This repository contains hardware designed by Luxonis. This camera is perfect for applications that require close-in depth and detail, such as quality control or automated manufacturing, and will prove especially valuable for mounting on robots or picking arms. The **OAK-D-LR** leverages our OAK-SoM-Pro to make a compact overall design. The use of the SoM reduces the overall design's scale, making it easier to mount or fit in various robotic processes. The design is also open-sourced, allowing for any necessary modifications.

You can buy OAK-D-LR on Luxonis store [OAK Cameras](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-d-lr).
