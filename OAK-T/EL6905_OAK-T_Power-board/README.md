# OAK-T

# Board layout & dimensions
OAK-T was made with intention that the overall size of the board would be as minimal as possible. 

Dimensions are represented below (renders including all components, some may not be populated in production variant):

Errata: there is the error in the boartd, which reusults in the GPIO levels on M8 connector for OUTPUT configuration 
only reach 1V8, but are 5V INPUT tolerant. This will be fixed in MP run.
