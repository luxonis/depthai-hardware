# Overview

This folder contains OAK-D Pro PoE files:

- [3D enclosure files](Mechanical)
- [3D PCBA files](3D_Models)
- [Datasheet](Datasheet)

This model has chip-down design, meaning the **Myriad X** is directly on the PCBA, not on the SOM. This makes the device a lot smaller/lighter, but due to the IP we can't open-source these designs.
